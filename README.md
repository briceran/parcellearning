# parcellearning

**parcellearning** is a set of classes and methods to learn the cortical surface map of an individual, using data computed from Magnetic Resonance Images.

**parcellearning** is primarily built around neocortical surface mesh representations of brain connectivity data computed from diffusion MRI and resting-state fMRI, along with scalar-valued data projected onto the same cortical surface mesh vertices.  Currently, this software is compatible with the .p (Python Pickle), .mat (Matlab), .nii (CIFTI), .gii (GIFTI), and .h5 (HDF5) file formats.  In the future, I hope to make the methodology compatible with volumetric data.
