# parcellearning

**parcellearning** is a set of classes and methods to learn the cortical surface map of an individual, using data computed from Magnetic Resonance Images.

**parcellearning** is primarilly built around surface mesh representations of brain connectivity data computed from diffusion MRI and resting-state fMRI, along with scalar-valued data projected onto surface mesh vertices.  Currently, this software is compatible with the .p (Python Pickle), .mat (Matlab), .nii (CIFTI), and .gii (GIFTI) file formats primarilly used by the Human Connectome Project (http://www.humanconnectome.org/).  Consequentially, it not yet compatible with volume-based data.
